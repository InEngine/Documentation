#The Premise Behind InEngine

Your content is the reason you have a website, but content without context looses meaning, emphases, and specificity. On the web the context for your content is what makes up the rest of your website. It is the layout and design of the site from images to typography. It is the data relationship between pieces of content. It is the features supplied, such as search, indexes, commenting. If your content needs context then why do we only have content management systems? Why do we not have website management systems. A system that manages both the content and the context. A system that makes it easy to have a consistent context for your content regardless of the viewing context (mobile, app, desktop). A system that integrates well with the platforms and networks you use that makes it easy to natively share your content with the appropriate context for the given platform or network. This idea of managing content and context is why we are building InEngine.
